# nuxt spa base package for EarthMountain Labs.

This repo contains a base set up for our vuejs/nuxt js projects.

This will allow us to very quickly build out client side SPAs for our clients with a lot of rich features. This is designed to be used along with our laravel backend base package but it can be extended for use with gooogle firebase or any other backend. 


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# After git clone remember to create a new repo for the project... DO NOT PUSH to this repo. 

# steps after repo reset

1. change project name
2. set api urls for axios, auth module, etc.
3. set up pusher account for the app if sockets to be used


# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
